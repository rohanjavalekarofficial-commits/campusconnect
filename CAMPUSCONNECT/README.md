## ⏰ Smart Lab Booking System (The Magic!)

### How It Works:

**Example Scenario:** A teacher books the AI Lab for **11:30 AM**

#### Step 1: Pre-Booking (11:20 AM)
- Python APScheduler checks all upcoming bookings
- Teacher receives **10-minute warning**: "🔔 Your lab class is about to start in 10 mins. Please confirm the booking."

#### Step 2: Class Starts (11:30 AM)
- Python sends **start notification**: "⏰ Your lab class has started. Please confirm the lab is engaged."

#### Step 3: Confirmation (11:30 AM - 11:45 AM)
- Teacher has **exactly 15 minutes** to click "Confirm & Engage"
  - ✅ **If Clicked:** Lab status turns **Red (Engaged)** - reserved for that teacher
  - ❌ **If Ignored:** At **11:45 AM**, Python **automatically cancels** the booking and frees the lab for others

## 🛠️ Background Tasks (APScheduler)

The system runs **4 automated background jobs** that check every minute:

1. **Lab Warning Notification (10 mins before)**
   - Sends "Your class starts in 10 minutes" alert
   
2. **Lab Start Notification (at exact booking time)**
   - Sends "Class has started, confirm engagement" alert

3. **Auto-Cancel Unconfirmed Labs (15 mins after start)**
   - Automatically cancels booking if teacher didn't confirm
   - Frees the lab for other bookings

4. **Auto-Cancel Interactive Classes**
   - Same logic for interactive classroom bookings

## 🧪 Testing the Lab Booking System

### Simulate a Booking:

1. **Login as Teacher**
2. **Go to "Book Lab" Tab**
3. **Select "AI Lab"** from dropdown
4. **Set date to today and time to** `11:30 AM`
5. **Click "Book Lab"** ✅

### See Notifications in Action:

Uncomment this line in `teacher_dash.html` (line ~450):
```javascript
// Uncomment to test notifications
setTimeout(() => showBookingNotification('warning', '🔔 Your lab class is about to start in 10 minutes...', 1), 5000);
setTimeout(() => showBookingNotification('started', '⏰ Your lab class has started...', 1), 20000);
```

This will show mock notifications after 5 and 20 seconds.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The system works perfectly on:
- ✅ Desktop computers (1920x1080, 1366x768)
- ✅ Tablets (iPad, Samsung Tab)
- ✅ Mobile phones (iPhone, Android)

Bootstrap 5 ensures automatic responsiveness.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Address already in use" error
```bash
# Change port in app.py
app.run(port=5001)  # Use a different port
```

### "Database locked" error
- Delete `database.db` and restart
- Or close other instances of the app

### APScheduler not working
- Make sure app runs with `python app.py`
- Check console for scheduler startup message
